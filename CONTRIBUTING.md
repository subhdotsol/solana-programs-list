# Contributing to Solana Programs Collection

## Welcome Contributors!

We appreciate your interest in contributing to our Solana programs repository. This document provides guidelines to help you contribute effectively.

## Contribution Process

1. **Fork the Repository**

   - Create a personal fork of the repository
   - Clone your forked repository locally

2. **Branch Strategy**

   - Create a new branch for each program or feature or bugfix
   - Use a clear, descriptive branch name
   - Example: `program/anchor-counter-program` or `feature/add-counter-program` or `fix/anchor-deployment-script`

3. **Program Submission Guidelines**

### Program Structure Requirements

- Each program must be in its own directory
- For Anchor framework programs:
  - **Folder Naming**: Must be prefixed with `anchor-`
  - Example: `anchor-counterapp`, `anchor-escrow`
- For native Solana programs:
  - Use descriptive, lowercase names
  - Example: `native-token-vesting`, `native-nft-marketplace`
- For other framework use similar patterns:
  - `[frameworkname]-counterapp`
  - `steel-counterapp` or `poseidon-counterapp`

### Submodule Submissions

- You can also contribute by adding your program as a **Git submodule** instead of directly including the code
- Submodule directory naming must follow the same conventions as above:
  - Anchor programs: `anchor-<program-name>` (e.g., `anchor-amm`, `anchor-lending-protocol`)
  - Native programs: `native-<program-name>`
  - Other frameworks: `[frameworkname]-<program-name>` (e.g., `pinocchio-amm`, `pinocchio-vault`)
- To add a submodule:
  ```bash
  git submodule add <your-repo-url> <framework>-<program-name>
  ```
  Example:
  ```bash
  git submodule add https://github.com/user/my-vault.git anchor-vault
  ```

4. Update the program index in `programs.md`.

### Code Quality

- Include comprehensive README in each program directory
- Provide clear installation and usage instructions
- Write unit tests for your programs
- Follow Rust and Solana best practices
- Use appropriate error handling
- Include comments explaining complex logic

### Documentation

- Update `programs.md` if adding a new program
- Update the main `README.md` if the top-level documentation also needs changes
- Provide a brief description of your program's purpose
- Include any blogs or documentations or videos you refered.
