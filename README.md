# Solana Programs Collection

A curated collection of Solana programs built with Rust.

## Repository Structure

Each program is organized in its own dedicated folder with a clear naming convention:

- Anchor framework programs: `anchor-[programname]`
- Native Solana programs: `native-[programname]`
- Other frameworks: `[framework]-[programname]`

## Program List

The full program index lives in [programs.md](programs.md).

## Prerequisites

- Solana CLI
- Rust
- Anchor (for Anchor framework programs)
- Node.js (for deployment and testing scripts)

2. Set up your Solana environment.
3. Navigate to the program directory you want to explore.
4. Follow the program-specific `README.md` instructions.
